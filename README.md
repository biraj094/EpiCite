### Overview

Current citation detection models rely on surface-level features — sentence length, document position, surrounding citation density — and treat all flagged sentences as functionally identical. They can identify *that* a citation might be missing but cannot explain *why*.

EpiCite addresses this by introducing an intermediate **epistemic layer**: a classifier that determines the linguistic purpose of a sentence before scoring its verifiability. This makes every prediction explainable in human terms: *"This sentence was flagged because it is classified as a Claim, and Claims are the strongest predictor of citation need."*

### Methodology

**1 — Feature Extraction**

Derives 12 interpretable linguistic features per sentence using spaCy and NLTK, grouped into three categories:

| Category | Features |
|---|---|
| Lexical | Vague quantifiers, hedging words, superlative adjectives |
| Syntactic | Passive voice, nominalization rate, POS ratios (NOUN/VERB/ADJ/ADV) |
| Contextual | Sentence position, citation density, paragraph-relative index |

**2 — Stage 1: Epistemic Classification**

A fine-tuned `distilbert-base-uncased` model classifies each sentence into one of five epistemic categories:

| Label | Definition |
|---|---|
| **Claim** | An assertion that takes a verifiable position on a topic |
| **Evidence** | Supports or refutes a claim, typically citing data or a source |
| **Opinion** | A subjective judgment, preference, or personal belief |
| **Background** | Neutral, contextual, or off-topic information |
| **Fact** | An objective, verifiable statement (future work) |

Three model tiers are evaluated: Logistic Regression baseline, BiLSTM intermediate, and DistilBERT proposed.

**3 — Stage 2: Citation Scoring**

The Stage 1 class probability distribution (5 values) is combined with the 12 linguistic features to form an 18-dimensional input vector fed into a Gradient Boosting classifier. Isotonic Regression calibrates the raw scores into well-calibrated probabilities on [0, 1].

**4 — Explainability**

SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values are computed for every prediction, identifying which features drove each citation flag. This directly addresses the interpretability gap in existing citation detection models.

### What Changed & Why

The original implementation had two critical problems discovered during error analysis:

1. **Stage 1 class imbalance** — The training corpus had 13,225 Claim sentences and only 204 Evidence sentences. With equal loss weights, Evidence contributed 0.7% of the total training signal. The model had no meaningful incentive to learn what Evidence looks like.

2. **Stage 2 feature bottleneck** — The original XGBoost Stage 2 only received 18 summary features — it never saw the actual sentence. The rich semantic context encoded in DistilBERT was completely discarded after Stage 1.

---

### Fix 1 — Stage 1 Weighted Retraining

**Problem:** Equal loss weights made the model ignore minority classes.

**Solution:** Inverse-frequency class weights applied to `CrossEntropyLoss`.

```
weight_c = N_total / (4 × N_c)
```

| Class | Samples | Raw Weight | Applied Weight |
|---|---|---|---|
| Claim | 13,225 | 0.52 | 0.52 |
| Background | 11,536 | 0.59 | 0.59 |
| Opinion | 2,433 | 2.82 | 2.82 |
| Evidence | 204 | 33.6 | **10.0** ← capped |

Evidence's weight is capped at 10× to prevent loss explosion. The model is retrained from the original checkpoint (not from scratch) at a conservative LR of 1e-5 for 4 epochs.

**Results (Test Set):**

| Metric | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| Macro F1 | ~0.72 | **0.80** ✓ |
| Evidence Recall | ~0.00 | **0.85** |
| Opinion F1 | ~0.76 | **0.84** |
| Accuracy | — | **80.7%** |

> ⚠️ Evidence test support = 20 samples. The 0.85 recall is directionally valid but statistically fragile. A dedicated Evidence corpus (FEVER, SciCite) is needed for robust evaluation.

---

### Fix 2 — Stage 2 Late-Fusion Architecture

**Problem:** XGBoost only saw 18 summary features, never the sentence itself.

**Solution:** A 3-layer MLP attached directly to DistilBERT's `[CLS]` token, fusing semantic embeddings with engineered features at the decision layer.

```
Sentence → DistilBERT → [CLS] (768-dim)
                                 │
                    concat with 18-dim feature vector
                                 │
                          786-dim combined
                                 │
              Linear(786→256) + LayerNorm + ReLU + Dropout(0.3)
                                 │
              Linear(256→64)  + LayerNorm + ReLU + Dropout(0.2)
                                 │
               Linear(64→1)   + Sigmoid
                                 │
                    Citation score ∈ [0, 1]
```

**Why LayerNorm instead of BatchNorm:** DistilBERT uses LayerNorm internally. BatchNorm behaves differently at train vs inference time and creates instabilities when mixed with Transformer layers. LayerNorm normalises per sample — consistent at any batch size.

**Training — 3-Phase Gradual Unfreezing:**

The MLP head starts from random weights. Immediately training all 66M DistilBERT parameters would corrupt the transformer before the head stabilises.

| Phase | What Trains | LR | Epochs | Val AUC |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 — Head only | MLP (218k params) | 1e-3 | 2 | 0.704 |
| 2 — Top 2 layers | MLP + last 2 transformer layers (14.4M) | 2e-5 | 3 | 0.755 |
| 3 — Full model | All 66.6M parameters | 5e-6 | 2 | 0.759 |

**Results (Test Set, WikiSQE `citation needed`, 1,000 sentences):**

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| ROC-AUC | **0.746** |
| Binary F1 | **0.684** |
| Accuracy | **68.4%** |
| Avg. Precision (PR-AUC) | **0.730** |
| Brier Score | **0.209** |

### SHAP Analysis — H1 Finding

**H1:** *Epistemic type is a stronger predictor of citation need than surface features.*

**Verdict: NOT SUPPORTED in current configuration.**

SHAP feature rankings (mean |SHAP| value):

| Rank | Feature | Value | Type |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `sentence_length` | 0.04598 | Linguistic |
| 2 | `passive_voice` | 0.01324 | Linguistic |
| 3 | `hedge_count` | 0.00647 | Linguistic |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |
| 11 | `epi_prob_Claim` | 0.00115 | **Epistemic** |
| 13 | `epi_confidence` | 0.00089 | **Epistemic** |

**Why H1 failed — domain mismatch:**

Stage 1 was trained on IBM/UKP debate text. When applied to Wikipedia prose, it labels **90.5% of sentences as Background** — nearly zero epistemic variance across 150k sentences. With constant output, SHAP correctly assigns low importance to epistemic features.

This is not evidence that epistemic type is unimportant — it is evidence that the epistemic classifier does not transfer to encyclopedic writing. H1 should be re-evaluated after retraining Stage 1 on Wikipedia-sourced epistemic annotations.

Mean epistemic probabilities by citation label (early H1 check):

| Label | `epi_prob_Claim` | `epi_prob_Background` |
|---|---|---|
| No citation needed (0) | 0.073 | 0.892 |
| Citation needed (1) | 0.102 | 0.863 |

The direction is correct (citation-needed sentences do have higher Claim probability) but the magnitude is too small to be a dominant signal.

### Known Limitations

| # | Issue | Impact | Proposed Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Stage 1 domain mismatch | Epistemic features near-useless for Wikipedia | Retrain Stage 1 on Wikipedia-sourced labels |
| 2 | Evidence data scarcity (204 samples) | Evidence F1 statistically fragile | Add FEVER / SciCite Evidence sentences |
| 3 | `sentence_length` dominates SHAP | Model exploits surface correlation | Length-normalised features or penalty term |
| 4 | Factual sentences over-flagged | "Water boils at 100°C" scores 0.66 | Length exploitation drives false positives |
